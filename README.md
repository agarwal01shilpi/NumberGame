# NumberGame 
hey! I've created an application named Number Game in which the system will select a number and you have to make guesses in the console view . If it matches ,then it's correct but in case it doesn't match,it will check whether the guessed number is bigger or smaller ,if it finds it smaller then a message will be displayed and same in the case of bigger number and finally your number of guesses will be displayed on the console .
