# NumberGame 
Hey! I've created an application named Number Game in which the system will select a number and you have to make guesses in the console view. If it matches, then it's correct but in case it doesn't match, it will check whether the guessed number is bigger or smaller, if it finds it smaller then a message will be displayed and the same in the case of a bigger number, and finally your number of guesses will be displayed on the console.
